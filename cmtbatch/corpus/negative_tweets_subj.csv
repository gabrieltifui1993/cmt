@Unocoin @zebpay @litecoin @mwkl5532 @Rms73849245 Most people in the crypto buying market right now don't care if a cryptocurrency is fast or not. They want to buy low and sell high. They see that happening with LTC   ETH  XRP etc. That's why they buy LTC. To make money. I am a holder of dgb.

Do you realize how demeaning it is to have to "earn" their money that devalues things of value  such as life  and overestimates the things that devalue such as porn and toxic tech that literally kills like wireless toys? #crypto
@CryptoBully @officialmcafee @nabs707 @AirnanArber @coinlab_info Ouch. Though I'd sincerely hope crypto had well recovered in 7 years! Also  shorting isn't selling at a loss to walk away. It's hedging/accumulating coins/quick profit. I'm only saying we need to be careful to say everything is bullish. New investors lose money and won't be back.
I believe the wide scale adoption of cryptocurrency as a payment method is inevitable. First the governments will issue a digital fiat currency/digital cash.This will lead to widespread merchant adoption of digital cashFrom there then it is only small step to accept crypto.

@Ripple @Cisco @rjr13579 @XRPTrump @antiprosynth Nope you haven't heard banks say they won't use DOGE  but the creator of that coin hasn't signed on any companies  plus that creator has no major company investors. XRP believers see far beyond just a crypto. Minimal research can offer much insight.
@aantonop @lopp @nick3ast @Gurbnk @natetalbot313 I agree a lot are on exchanges just not the majority. What do you think would happen with an govt confiscation of all coinbase crypto? Govt have plenty of tools it's just a question of how far they will go.

@CryptoCred @theperson3233 That makes no sense. 1) Not everyone in crypto claims to hate fiat. 2) Those who hate fiat clearly mean they hate the centralization of most money + power in the hands of a few  and the ability to print unlimited currency  and the avg ppl deal w/ consequences

@IvanOnTech Peeps on mainstream see crypto as they do and peeps on altstream as the many so called experts on altstream say it is. If as so called experts say the new low will be 8.3k - 7.3k It is not a far stretch to say they are basically creating their own future = Mentors = followers.

If it hits 3k  it would be bad for the whole crypto scene as a whole. My thought is  people will be afraid to jump in because of the crash  which at that point  it would be a full on crash. Say what you will about buying cheap coins  but without fresh money  prices stay low. IMO
However  it is important to note that Bitcoin’s price fluctuations and movements are still heavily linked to all other coins. The saying that: ‘the tide moves all boats’ is still true in the cryptocurrency market with Bitcoin essentially being the tide.

2/ However  in most cases  they are presented as conceptual theories. I know there is currently a battle between the crypto space and government regulators the world over. It would seem that Crypto has to reach some sort of critical mass  as far as consumer adoption is concerned
1/ As a relative newcomer to #bitcoin and other #cryptocurrency  I see a lot of information about the price movement of these coins and tokens. However  I see precious little about real world adoption of Crypto and their platforms. Yes  there are whitepapers to analyse.

@Crypto_Bitlord @WhatBitcoinDid No  market makers post a bid and an ask and just follow the flow of the market. If a lot of people sell at 10k  they will retreat to 9k (why buy @ 10 if they are willing to sell @ 9?) Same with the ask (why sell @ 10 if they are willing to buy @ 11?)
@Crypto_Dwight There are couple coins it currently doesn't beat buy and hold on but over the long run I am feeling that it will. Some coins have weird spikes that don't last long and it's hard to get in and out. The rest of the time they trade flat. If the trend doesn't extend it fails.
@MikeRicci5 That should be a new form of crypto-currency
For the majority of people  access to acquire Bitcoin  or other cryptocurrencies  can be severely hampered by denying credit card (maybe later debit card) purchases.The lack of an ability to purchase is an effective ban.Later can also institute a high trading tax on crypto.

@Telegraph @Daniel_Grigg @Thomason97J Gambling means that you can loose the money. Spending on Bitcoin or other Cryptos is not connected to fiat currencies and you do not loose the Crypto. It is a free market economy  which means its price is only determined on the amount of people who own it.

@Socal_crypto I had a similar hunch  they're greedy and gonna get in cheap as possible  long-term it's more valuable for btc to go to the moon than for it to go to zero. I don't share these thoughts because I'm a crypto newb of like 2 years.

@crypto_birb Isnt this one big joke by justin who played this market like a boss becoming a billionair selling baked air?
Who buys crypto because it is nothing but action? Who sells the bottom of a blockchain reaction and trades a whole Bitcoin for only a fraction?

@nasirjones007 I agree that 5k is the final destination  but I believe the local bottom is in. Time will tell  you have been consistent and spot on. DXI comparison shows that you know what you are talking about on a bigger scale  while they just look at crypto.
Could of predicted this (and I did)  India banning crypto was FAKE NEWS
Banks/credit companies banning crypto purchases is a declaration of war on crypto. Expect more bad news after SEC/CFTC meeting. They can and will slow down crypto growth  but in the end the tech will adapt and come stronger than ever!
It is 3 am where I live  and I'm scared to sleep. #crypto :(
@beatthealgo Do you use ICT methods on crypto or just focus on traditional forex markets?
@Cernovich Haha. Well I’m 0-3 there. I’m curious about crypto though.
A thought. Crypto is going nowhere. However after this washout we are entering a new phase of regulation. Legitimate projects with real use cases will be around in the coming years. Get rich quick projects with no tech or use case and community backing will die. Be selective.
@litecoindad Keep buying  constantly clearing peoples misconceptions  promoting heavily when teaching friends about crypto. I've rarely been as passionate about something as I am for litecoin.

@AltOne_Crypto @PhilakoneCrypto That was quick ;)
@Mokolpop @crypto_goat_ @MilitantBitcoin @StealthyMoney Smart money has 3x their money at the very minimum on $XRP. If you’ve lost money you deserved it for buying something after a 10x move
If you have not figured this out yet  I am all for using #Robinhood for my trades in #cryptocurrency  eagerly waiting for them to open up for trading.   I am set  moved money into the site from my bank  easy  all done by using my phone. Coinbase too slow #xrp
For the record  I'm still taking profit to fiat whenever I lock any in on a trade/other ventures in $crypto (shocking I know  trading isn't the only way to profit).#Bitcoin is still $8000 and I have targets for diversification of my portfolio this year that I mean to fulfill.
@La__Cuen @vinarmani @crypto_daze I think you got it backwards.Lightning = Small fast payments the anyone including the poor can use. You only need a little bitcoin.Bitcoin = High security payments  makes sense to use it for big txns (what you may call the wealthy)
@Plinz More reason why that is not a problem. I still think everything said by Bostrom and his doomsayer cultists fall into the not even wrong category. It would be amusing if so many people didn't buy into this crypto-creationist nonsense.

the truth about crypto is it only goes up when people aren't dumping...which is like once a month. he dumping never stops. and when volume is low  no way for an asset to rebound. it's a losing game unfortunately.

@Crypto_Bitlord There are so much money waiting on the side all bids are at 7k level. If there is only a catalyst that pushes the price to 10k these people will FOMO and chase the price once again . There is no volume on the decline which makes the bear market unconfirmed . Bulls game.

@VibeHubVR @As_I_Follow111 Never said it wasn’t exciting for crypto. But yes  all companies what to create hype around their projects. Almost all news is hype news. “Hype” gets taken out of context sometimes when mentioned and people think “fake news”  which is what I WASNT getting at.
@parabolictrav @IanPanchevre And if it goes to 1k or MUCH lower then I'll likely be adding a bunch more to my holdings and then wait for the huge turnaround several years from now. That's if it completely crashes. I don't necessarily think thats coming but we'll see cuz it certainly could. Crypto is crazy.
@Crypto_Bitlord Still some hours to go ;)
Another dip  picked up some more $ETH and $ENG.  Ensuring you have risk management in place and proper sized Crypto portfolio makes these drops in price actually exciting instead of scary.

@andupotorac 65% drop is a lot even for crypto...it's smashing supports like knife through butter...i'll see you at 1-2k :(
@davecraige Short of creating your own coin for 0 cost and selling it  there is no way to make higher profit multiples in $crypto than by spec mining  where you either mine an under-the-radar chain in hopes of capital gains later  or you mine newly-launched PoW coins.
So cryptocurrency is dead right
@CryptoMink Until u see eth at $200 or neo at $25 or ripple at 20 cents  we are far from over on this crash.  We should hit those lows by April . Let’s see when your coin is down 90% and see if u still believe in crypto .  Make your money and let the next young kid hold your bag bro.

@whalepool That was all your SEC government officials buying the dip before they come out with the big decision that crypto is all good...
Funny reading all of these Crypto crash articles. They didn't even experience the 90% crash in 2013-14. This is nothing.
@jeremyrwelch The point is  Bitcoin/crypto does not solve the barbarian problem. Perhaps due to its anominity  it does the opposite.
I still remember not having the internet & freinds not having internet many years ago. Its almost impossible to think of life without it now. Will #crypto and #xrp #ripple #xrpthestandard be the next internet?
You LIE to investors. Change everything at the last minute. If you change everything you should return money to all ICO's Buyers. I hope karma comes and get you in the worst possible way not just with you but your families . Have a great life............Thanks
EDA tools must be the perfect place to hide a crypto coin miner. They run for a long time  uses lots of resources and have phone home functionality that can't be disabled. No one would ever notice
@Crypto_Core too many drugs in your nightstand friend <Emoji: Frowning face><Emoji: Crazy face>
@Willwaukee @lopp @mtoa17 Wrong. Crypto-asset is a bullshit term someone made up so they can reclassify Bitcoin for you. Fuck them. I don't know what "crypto-assets" are. I know what Bitcoin is. I know what "cryptocurrencies" are  but "crypto-assets" could be anything.
@Liqui_Exchange guys  do you know where this exchange is based from?  the place it's based from is in a civil war  and this is crypto  so don't be surprised if anything happens  I'm actually amazed that it's still running and they're still up
@Ripple @Cisco @rjr13579 @ZIGXRP I've been following Ripple and their countless publicity stunts and rebranding of the same old tech since as early as 2013. There is nothing in the slightest that indicates XRP to be a likely standard for anything so far. There are far more likely candidates in crypto.
@Andrew_B_Bader i think its pretty dangerous to take a short position in an irrational market  as opposed to an overvalued one  especially one like crypto that seems like its being obviously manipulated.
@Mytham1998 @Crypto_Bitlord @CryptoCobain that part is clear.. whats not clear  and I think is the most important part  is when the recovery start.. Now or at 6-5k?If we close below Daily 200EMA I Think 5K$ is you capitulation bottom.. hopefully
@RobinhoodApp @zer_mox One time advertising is short lived! Money to burn  but Coinbase are web based company I think spend wiser.

@officialmcafee I think right now  in the present state of crypto currency. Unfortunately we have a lot of milenieals investing. They have weak hands and an instant gratification thing going on.  As soon as they see a small dip they sell for a loss.
For anyone worried about governments banning cryptocurrency  remember that they have also banned drugs  guns and racism. Right or wrong these things persist #btc #Bitcoin #cryptocurrencies #cryptocurrency #crypto #alts
@SwiftOnSecurity @MrGlaive Which I'm fine with(Gridcoin is very unlikely to actually shoot up very high in price in the crypto markets because it has no particular selling point other than that mining it helps search for a cure for cancer  which crypto nerds don't really care about because they suck)
But seriously  #Crypto newbies  if you want to run scared have at it. But as for me  I'm staying put. Going to watch some TV  relax  enjoy the day  and keep waiting. #TheRunIsComing #Bitcoin
what does crypto mean @Michael5SOS
@crypto_bobby @DominicBreslin Jacked....yeah it’s not good slang.
@officialmcafee It's not about the price of BTC. It's the coordinated attack form the corrupt banks and governments on cryptocurrency is what's making people depressed

@Socal_crypto It’s every bit as bad as a gambling habit
@CryptoBully @LukasGilmore2 Maybe so  but crypto exchanges are nearly identical to brokerages like e-trade and fidelity. Also  stocks can lose/gain value just like crypto. Banks only want to protect themselves from potential losses. Lastly  it isn’t your $ when u use cc.

@crypto_goat_ I agree #BCH has its place  great store of  value & currency. The reality is that it's not the #OGofCrypto. the vast majority crowned BTC the king so we live with it or start a MASSIVE & costly marketing campaign to dethrone BTC.. I don't hear noobs taking about BCH.
@Socal_crypto naww.. you're just a hopeless romantic.  or a fucking frothing blood drunk bull.  hard to say.
@twobitidiot The tricky thing is how to define the test for membership in your club. People who have published working code? Teams that have testnets up? Etc. I agree that crypto conf with only ppl who actually understand it would be amazing. I'd consider having it be the only one I attend.
@Aboundlessworld @CryptoBully I think the bigger issue regardless of your "opinion" on what ppl should be buying with credit is the precedent that their actions set. So you can buy everything else on credit except crypto then what? What else do they ban?

Lindy effect is agnostic to the underlying. It’s easy to think it only applies to crypto. Contrary to the currently dominating narrative  centralized institutions benefit from it to an equal degree.

Only invest in crypto what you’re willing to lose most of.

@crypto_rand These are classic tweets of weak & inexperienced hands. To many people want to get rich overnight..if the guy holds he will be one of the few that will be ok because it looks like he bought before the Xmas pump when the dust settles  when that will be though I couldn't tell you.
Upon further consideration I have decided NOT to sell the account. I realized that I am still doing #crypto full time just focused in a different area. I am planning to open a private group that will focus primarily on Bitmex signals  coin signals  and ICO pools. Cheap entry.
I encourage a #boycott of any bank or credit card company that bans you from purchasing #crypto. It's the principle of the matter that they now consider themselves your "protector" against yourself. Verifying is one thing  banning is is a whole new level of control.
Yet people who started investing into crypto's mid-december are now down 40-65%. It's pretty sick actually.

@crypto_goat_ I'm surprised people actually worship what is really just clever code.
@Crypto_Dwight The reason is two fold. Leverage and shorting. It makes money on the downtrend as well as the up. But the settings and positioning must be right. Out of the box the answer is no.
@_Prage @officialmcafee Finally someone with some brains speaks.  Crypto will only go down when people sell. Anyone with a little knowledge of supply and demand can tell you this.

Some called the second higher low of the reversal at 8.5k. I think we made it just now at 7.9k. BUT I think we could see more bear territory. Volume was weak. Half that of the original dip to 7.5k. To be bullish we need to see 9.5/10k by the weekly close. #btc #Crypto
@NeocashRadio @MatGroennebaek @Bitfinexed @CDH_Crypto @BryceWeiner @kwayneshantz @untetherbtc That would be 85% fall from 20k  which is a pretty extreme forecast.I believe we won't fall below 6k  unless Tether crashes. But let's see  crypto market is insane.
Silver lining of all the crypto prices crashing is that all the miners who ruined the GPU market got fucked over
@CRYPTOPIEP This is fake news. Those machines are fiat ATMs already exists all around the country. They do a lot more just than deposit & withdraw. Those machine are very advanced and capable of account opening & KYC at the spot. But it has NOTHING to do with crypto.

I got into #crypto 10 months ago. Ive invested  took profits it’s all free $ now.this is my 1st #bearmarket.Ive realised I’m not a trader but I rate my portfolio long term . Think I’ll delete my blockfolio and look again in the summer $btc $eth $icx $neo
@Joe_Gatchalian @Blindside007 @Crypto_Rach I’m so turned on right now... eventhough you’re my brother.
@CryptoBully @officialmcafee @nabs707 @Cryptonanza It will take some rather important news to break the pattern - which is unlikely to happen too soon. G20 crypto regulation this week is very likely to feed the bears.
@Bamabroker Ignore him.  He's salty af he missed the crypto boat and just pulls garabage out of his ass like most who know nothing about it.  Guy's a clown who often boats about markets.  I feel for those who take him seriously.
A giant botnet is forcing Windows servers to mine cryptocurrency
@officialmcafee Sadly they don't. Chase and Bank of America stopping customers from making crypto purchases with their own credit cards  shows the levels of fear from which they operate and will only stoke the fires of rebellion.
@Bitfinexed I was major Goxed  I see no similarities.Karpeles owned Collapse 1.0 because he was an idiot  you own Collapse 2.0 because you work it. vanDerVelde  might be a crook but maybe not but he's given the crypto what it needs  an innovative parking lot. What have you done?

@Bleeding_Crypto So alts should recover faster because they are smaller fishes?
@AudioDaze I hear you. they are saying it's a risk. but my point is  if I decide to buy a $4000 superbowl ticket or $4000 worth of crypto  which one is likely to have any return? if I am weighing risks  any consumable is out the door. can't buy gas  food  entertainment etc because 0% return
@Crypto_Bitlord @coastalcryptoLA You couldn't be more wrong.
@Crypto_Dwight Closed NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP to come crashing down Bc of the SIZE of it.  No one cares about $BCH. Not when $BTC can’t make it to grandma use level. $BCH’s offering isn’t going to magically uproot that fact.   ZERO. Lol.
@aantonop @lopp @nick3ast @MoneyEvil @natetalbot313 Time will tell! I will be looking closely at developments. I am just reading that US banks have collectively made it impossible to buy crypto with their creditcards.

I understand the risk involved with crypto transactions and why banks are taking such precautions  but I’m also afraid these precautions will eventually deter modern bankers from choosing traditional banks.
@ZuluAfrika @emilykatwilson They get it.. you wanted instant buy which is available via the CC  but the banks are restricting the CC purchases as this might create a credit bubble  as people are maxing out their CC for buying the crypto. And if the market doesn't recover soon  it going to be a huge mess.

Normies wanted to jump in and buy $BTC on the way up when it was $15k-20k. After $BTC finds its bottom (probably around $5k)  the very same people wouldn't want to buy crypto for shit. Funny how that works.
I’ll have to tell you after the conference. I’m by no means an expert. But I like what they stand for and the people behind it. I evaluate crypto the same way I do stocks; the people and their motivation(s). But maybe my friend @BobSummerwill could do Eth more justice than me!
I can only thank God I survived the really reckless and silly things I did in that crypto market. One day sha  when the dust settles  I'll share my story.

@stacyherbert @zooko All I see is a leading coin with more than 4x the transactions of another leading coin. Rather easy to tell which one is actually getting used. But let's not kid ourselves  even a million tx per day is pretty pathetic. Crypto needs to do a million per second.

@Bitfinexed @CryptoHedge_ @whalepool @e101y7 @Sunny_Singh10 @ponzi_panther IF Tether is a scam on the scale u claim  we'd have hit $50K. Until hard evidence  I'll choose the likely scenario that we have easily over 1billion new accounts in crypto this past year. Of course Tether got made or it would be $500+ instead of $.998

Crypto is all about human behavior and psychology! I fight my own tendencies everyday for example my gut says $ETH is at $800  that’s a steal and it will quickly go back up to $1400.  Welll on Jan 1st after a nice run it was at $700 now it sounds expensive.

@CryptoBully While it's true that people shouldn't be buying crypto on credit  the issue is the censoring of customer's purchases. They've let people ruin their lives for years making extremely risky and stupid purchases they cant pay back.

For everyone curious about crypto rn  this is a temp downturn. Buy in the dip but hold on. #hodl I am hanging onto a lot of crypto rn because I believe in the tech or people behind it.
@21Cryptos hello!! Would you guys be interested in some top notch visual crypto renders/concepts for your mag? Have been working in a few concepts  all 3D renders and unique.
Finally everyone in $CRYPTO start speaking about the 2014 bear market <Emoji: Clown face>time to buy $BTC (or wait if like me you don't even know what is $USD value)
@Cryptonary_ @RayRedacted Ain’t that the truth. New people enter and there is no history book on any of this crypto hype lending scamming unfortunately. The scammers will get money and people will lost. But good luck to the scammers ever getting some fiat out of it. Wanna cry is still dry I think
Prediction: the next crypto pump will be bitcoin pumping and not alts. The needed consolidation into bitcoin will finally occur and new hands will learn the value of hodling.
Do you know who refunds crypto invesments? Anyone? Please! It's urgent! It was all grand mistake! :'(
1. stay calm and #hodl on your good projects that are way oversold. 2. sump your useless tron  verge  ripple etc.  buy a bunch of $WTC and take time off crypto. I will remind you in 2 months time!

@CryptoSassassin BTC and other cryptocurrency are gonna make bigger gains than gold the comming years imo.
@crypto_rand @Concept211 I did! Called it yesterday. It's called a false bottom and false breakout. Typical trading 101.
@crypto_rand @CryptoSays All them margin longs getting liquidated :o
@cryptostardust @Crypto_Dwight @itsawrightoff Doesn't feel like the bottom  no mass panic... Could be that most of the weak hands have sold throughout this whole downtrend though and there won't be a mass panic. Time will tell..

If youve been selling crypto since the all time highs  you're not welcome to buy back in. Stick to your slave master's Fiat game.

@Altcoinbuzzio I dont think a new car is at the top of my list if I reach any success wth crypto. I would spend smart  buy land  go off grid  then think about if I want any new cars. Most likely I'd grab a Tesla and a custom off grid conversion mobile home
So crypto currency is 100% a scam! Controlled by a few people to fuck the rest over! Shame could have been good. Bye bye bitcoin  this worlds just to evil for the likes of you!

@_B_I_O_T_E_C_H_ @Lblegend33 Not sure if funny or sad there's prob $0 retail dollars (relatively speaking) in these biotech companies compared to tech or crypto. It's all hedge funds and big pharma battling it out. I think it's prob better this way as retail gets involved it becomes a mess.
@Crypto_Brahma Everyone except Bravado thinks current is junk. will be interesting to see how it pans out.

@officialmcafee Institutional money was never going to jump into crypto at the ATH and make all is little guys rich in the process  that not what they do. They manipulate markets  using the media  and they shake out the weak hands so they can scoop up everything they want for fractions of the $
@officialmcafee So India 2 days back in the budget declared cryptocurrency as illegal and the market fell immediately...... I'm not sure how to feel about this

You believe the 99% Fake News you read about crypto form the pushers of utter CRAP. I mean mainstream media BBC  CNN  FT etc they are Bitcoin haters  attacking any chance they get.
Sell Up  get out of the market and let me BUY your Crypto. We dont need your pathetic winging involvement anyway.
I hate crypto currency  I do... mainly because I was up and went to bed up. Woke up down 2k... F U
@crypto_rand I am curious if you are also trapped or was smart enough to exit in time?
@MagUra_Crypto @naveen you were wrong! Mwa ha ha
@crypto_rand So therefore BTC can go up or BTC can go down. Happy its narrowed down to those 2 variables...
@crypto_rand I'll keep this a secret between us thanks bae :)
I follow this random <Emoji: Electric plug> on snap and he was talking crypto this  bitcoin that  litecoin thems. Saying he could give people advice on crypto. Then that bubble burst  and now he's just posting joints he rolled earlier lmaooo
Fuck u crypto I needa pay bills.
@JohnKGraham7 @officialmcafee Also  the success of every crypto  thus far  has been due to hype and manipulation. People are getting tired of the hype and weary of the manipulation. Also  the people who mortgaged theor houses to buy BTC and get rich got hammered and lost a ton of $. They're not coming back.

@Crypto_Skipper Most coins I see has near zero value though. The bet is usually that enterprise adoption somehow magically translates into demand for the coin which is patently untrue in any situation where we can assume liquidity and tx costs by design should be low. Value will not be captured.
@BTCTN Everyone's clamping down at the moment. They're afraid. I believe a lot of these. And are only short term solutions until governments and other regulatory body's can come up with long term solutions. Crypto is here to stay.

In the case of Litecoin vs. Bitcoin  there are two key points that should be looked at. If you are looking to purchase for the long term  Bitcoin is your best bet  and if you’re looking to transfer and spend cryptocurrency on a regular basis  Litecoin is the better option.

@bionhart All progress is cumulative. Like the paper  but still think most critics are incentivized to naively discount crypto's financial utility (despite status quo's archaic architecture + terminal dysfunction as of late).
@yoniassia @cryptomanran You missed one of the main ones in my opinion. Misinformation  Crypto Trolls spreading false stories to frighten investors
Never invest more than you are willing to lose. The entire crypto market could tank today and I would only lose what I had deemed as ok. But it's the huge potential upside that has made me risk the money I have put in now. And I keep itching to want to put in more.

@LitecoinAnalyst Gutsy call. I see all crypto off 50-80 percent from today’s prices. Until we get a true crash I’m sitting it out. Easy money is over..... Once we get past all the reg news it’ll go way up.
@officialmcafee The short term investors expecting to get rich overnight are certainly part of the problem  the portion of crypto advocates(not you) who are in denial of how markets work  another. I have seen numerous people take the argument of 'no one has lost money on bitcoin'
@Crypto_Skipper People are wrong that incentives must be paid out in crypto. This set up eases scaling but is not necessary. Once the trust is bad meme is dead this will become evident. Tokens will be used for paying ledger transactions  however  simply because it makes a lot of sense.

@paulkrugman @davetimesone @Btcplace To be fair.... Their anti-security through centralization allows for credit card purchases to be protected... Also allowing debt issuance...

@PeterSchiff Why do you WANT #bitcoin to fail so bad? If it fails then the tech behind some great cryptocurrency and block chain projects (that could change the world for the better) probably goes with it. You seem so bent on its failure that you ignore the good block chain could do the world
@Crypto_Skipper That's a loaded question. There will be a currency which is likely used on the blockchain and utilities and contracts being used to send data through a secure network but the fact that they are even called "currencies" now is obscene. The majority are not intended to be used

@Citi As a 9 year customer  I have to say that I'm lately very disappointed with many of the changes you've made. If I want to buy crypto  that's my choice. You're not going to stop consumer behavior. Rather  you're going to encourage people like me to cancel with you.
@WuytsT I really hate it...like their products are secure...look at the stock market what a sell off how many people losing money nobody say something but crypto’s!!!!

@crypto_rand So  what does it mean? Up from here?
@Crypto_Skipper that's insane!
@Brad2pointO @TonyORivera But no one knows which crypto to back. There are over 1500 & it’s reasonably possible the success stories don’t even exist today- something like Kodak’s planned crypto. It’s also just as likely Bitcoin becomes redundant when replaced by better alternatives & becomes worthless.

@crypToBanger @crypto_monopoly @cryptotho @Glock_Chain Just commenting on what was already mentioned. 2013-2017 was a 4 year accumulation (after 2013 crash). Do I think it's gonna happen? No. But if it does  it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing was my point
Everytime banks and gov’s find new rules to block or ban crypto’s  only to protect their own power and influence  technology will find ways to continue. Crypto and #bitcoin can and will not be stopped. #cryptocrash #cryptocurrency #blockchain #future #btc #Ethereum
@CryptoGat I'm getting drunk regardless. I don't have 300% return crypto  but I still have 100% return on crypto.
@SamHarrisOrg @CRYPTO__CHAOS I agree  that perspective is a straw man.  Sam certainly isn’t saying that.
@rudresh92 All right there? No crypto tweets from you lately :P
@AlexChoOfficial Couldn't agree more. I always say there are 3 types of people regarding crypto rn. 1. Smart people who researched it a lot & see the value.2. Smart people who haven't researched enough & bc they're smart they dont take the risk.3. Stupid people that will never understand it.
@jayden_crypto Fake lol
@cryptomocho The stock market is crashing   Japan futures looks terrible and we could be looking at black Monday when US markets open . Expect crypto to crash harder than stocks short term .

I love bitcoin. Don’t get me wrong. Fuck the fed and all that. But you have to go with the flow and the flow is toward pushing crypto to the fringe.

Found some old crypto wallets. Kinda afraid to open them (not even sure how...). I don't think they have a lot in them  but a "tiny amount" of coins back in 2012ish probably has some value today. Maybe it's for the best they were lost for so long...I probably would have sold.

@PACcoinOfficial @Cypher4141 Sorry to hear  I know it’s rough sometimes  but as I’m sure you know crypto is volatile. And while it can create big opportunities it can also create short term losses but you don’t lose money until you exit a position at a loss so hang in there. It always rebounds.
What’s your point then? I guess you weren’t very clear. It makes perfect sense  the majority owners of crypto control this game  we are just along for the ride.

@HighAltitudeInv @AprilMoffatt1 @Crypto_Musico It can be relevant because in a market people often react in a same way  that is why technical analyses pretty much works.

@NellieBowles @sameepa Puerto Rico's electric utility is relatively expensive to operate. There are no economies for mining crypto on the island. Blockchain is a different issue and one that the crypto boys should address with PR govt.
@CryptoBully @IntoTheLite_ @Socal_crypto Just because profit is unrealized doesn't mean you aren't getting rekt. Preserving capital is just as important as making it for a trader. If your long term investor i would understand.
what will be strange is when the market finally calms and settles at a price point for btc and alt coins. When it's all mainstream. That'll be really weird. Being stable and all. #btc #vtc #etc #eth #ltc #cryptocurrency #cryptocrash #coinbase #coinmarketcap $btc $ltc $eth $etc

@Crypto_Wizardz Yes  and your also very modest  probably more modest than we can imagine really.
@Bitfinexed @CryptoHedge_ @whalepool @ponzi_panther Last thing. I think you're dismissing the massive growth of sheer account numbers in the space. Not that's it's not possible  but would be incredibly stupid of them to do as u claim. Bigger crypto gets  the more I see why the sheep have been slaughtered. Cannibals
Crypto boys are sold on the dogma of the virtual concept  but they all overlook the fatal flaw that any seasoned "Wall Street" investor would look at  the blockchain technology is not proprietary. A virtual cookie in a future dream for anyone who can explain why that's important.
Pre-sale ICO discounts for accredited investors is a scam to make rich people richer. Giving verified rich people 50% off a token because they invest before retail investors means guaranteed doubling their money at the expense of the little guy. #ico #btc #crypto #presale #eth
As if this proposal in itself weren’t ambitious enough  the whitepaper also states that the $OMG coin also seeks to liquidate between fiat to any cryptocurrency as well. Each of these transactions would also take place on $OMG’s blockchain.

@officialmcafee Banks should be scared shitless... Money creation on the Blockchain is ‘a bit’ more difficult than pressing ‘enter’ in their ‘createmoneyforfree’ vaults.I do expect a hefty bloodbath in their efforts to destroy crypto. Futile  of course.

@Halmachine I don't like the dismissive attitude people have about "buy a lesser card". Why don't you guys buy lesser cards? But muh hash rates? Well my frame rates. It's this sort of thing that turns people against crypto.
@tweetscottbates @WS2X12 @officialmcafee This is why they're fighting so hard. Unless they can get crypto to behave exactly as fiat currencies do  which filters power and wealth to the established stakeholders  they have little use for it.
@Ivancalkins To be honest  dgd seems like a bet against crypto. It only does well when the market is down. I will go all in on dgd in January next year <Emoji: Face with tears of joy>

@CryptoBully Don’t agree with the practice but it should be allowed the same way cash advances are allowed on cards. $Crypto will teach individuals to be responsible for their own actions. Some will be baptized with fire. Let them. Plenty of smart advice doesn’t mean they will take it.

@mdudas @JPQ No James-- u have to do a work around of Squaring yourself & sacrificing the initial 2.9% for the conversion. Buying crypto w CCs was insane
@BTCDJS @iamjosephyoung I personally don't want a currency to be as volitale as any crypto.

But I am afraid that bulls won't be able to keep 8000 support line and will give it away to bears  which is a quite possible scenario. So far  I don't see any bullish indicators.#Blockchain #Binance  #Bitcoin #ICO #cryptocurrency #btcusdt #ripple #litecoin #etherium #airdrop

@mattmillerink @standwithdick @No_Appli Finance falls outside of my expertise. Damn it  I'm a doctor not a magician. The crypto market is extremely volatile. I know that creating your own coin is a 20 bazillion dollar idea  however  being an early adopter of a growing market is still lucrative.
@Crypto_God Do you mean Carlos Matos?
@Michael5SOS i was so confused when i got a notification from ‘crypto boi’
#Crypto friends  put this in perspective about this crash:Last time #Bitcoin hit $8500 last year  #XRP was at roughly 22¢. Today BTC is at $8300  & XRP is at 81¢.What does this mean?Coins are stronger than ever before. & growing with strong tech. The future is strong.
@scalefree @elementus_io Every risky purchase you've outlined falls under a regulated market. Cryptocurrencies is partially singled out because it is not. You can't sit there and tell me you're unaware of the MASSIVE scams on multiple levels plaguing the honesty of good #crypto projects doesn't exist?
The best part of this thread is all the guys with names like "crypto_einstein69" getting mad and explaining how bitcoin actually works but still getting it wrong
@crypto_rand sad story of Fud....

If this scares you - lets face it  you should not be in crypto markets in the first place. The rest of the guys  prepare for some turbulence. When the skies clear out  we will have an amazing year together with so many new opportunities opening at very low prices.
@landon_wiggs Crypto rides and dies with bitcoin. Look at bitcoin move and watch every other coin. I suggest you look into gold ;)

@Michael5SOS Can't wait crypto boi. I have nothing new and cool to listen... sgfg is like an echo in my head...
@mdudas @rabois Crypto in general should think of ways to reverse trx  whether for a mistake or good not delivered. It’s one of the critical elements of payments
@Cernovich @JonasGrumble No argument there. Crypto is designed to take that control away. BTC is only one currency. There are many others designed to be more secure  untraceable and anonymous. Check out Monero (XMR) or "ZCash" for instance. It's not about buying tulips. It's about decentralized money.
@sunnycoastone Thank you. I'm strong blockchain technology believer and I'm aware the total crypto market cap will change it's order of magnitude many times in following years and no one knows what will happen. Amazon  Google  Ebay survived dot-com bubble  crypto will have it's survivors too.
@barstoolsports @CaderSteve Even though im a new york fan  you are right... except for the yankees (possibly the giants) and the knicks
@Michael5SOS literally had no idea why i got a tweet notification from crypto boi only to find out it’s just you <Emoji: New moon with face>
@Michael5SOS i was so confused when i got a notification saying ‘new tweet from crypto boi’
@mattmarohl It makes sense until cryptocurrency is regulated.  In the US you can’t legally use your credit card to finance gambling which is pretty much what this is.  I liken it to the Holland Tulip debacle.
Bear times are not fun but it's when you gain the best position. Not many want to engage when prices are falling more than they're rising. I think we're long overdue for this major correction but it's crypto so expect the unexpected. This game is far from over.
@Michael5SOS I have your notifs on and I saw ‘crypto boi’ and I thought ‘who the fuck is that’ and it’s you! It’s bloody Michael Clifford. Btw I miss 5sos  please release new music and come back go England. I miss you

@Michael5SOS I was so confused of who crypto boi was and right before it popped up i said "swear to god if its michael..."
@Michael5SOS I was confused who it was when I got the notification of “crypto boi tweeted” <Emoji: Face with tears of joy>

@Barnacules My crypto is doing so bad  i can't afford the brand stuff anymore too
For those who put their head in the sand and say they dont understand cryptocurrency  the one key principle is private money versus government fiat currency.  The private sector will always create a superior product
Correct me if I'm wrong  but the price of #ether is higher today than it was when the crypto market cap was twice as high. I take that too mean that people are fleeing to coins with real value. This is a good sign for the future

That's one of the problems with Cryptocurrency - its a corrupt ecosystem that isn't regulated by any governing power. It's decentralized racketeering setup  with a mix of good people trying to legally utilize it.

@maxkeiser I do not think everything else is the same. There also are a LOT of new strong hands in crypto.
If you believe in crypto you would never say "only invest what you can afford to lose"
@Ripple @ArminVanBitcoin @SwenLink Spreading FUD  however  especially spreading biased fud for childish reasons - if you can gather all your braincells at one place  concentrate for 13 5 minutes and read: all i imply is that IF you want crypto to succeed  embrace the real world connections  as they connect to all.

But it's important to know some of the history and just where and how these symbols first started. With various movements taking on and creating new symbols  sometimes for hate  know that not every new symbol you encounter is in fact some crypto-fascist icon.
@JohnMoralesNBC6 The only people celebrating are those in the crypto tech bubble. We've seen this before and it hasn't ended well. Same wolf. Now wears a "smart belt"
@officialmcafee We will eventually see banks that store crypto because the process is not easy for the layman who isn't tech savvy. Then people will want to spend crypto without withdrawing it  etc.  So crypto banks
@SunCoastChief Crypto isn’t going anywhere.  It’ll be incorporated in everyday life in 5 years.  Soon BTC may not be the leader anymore though  as fees are now huge for transfers and transfer times slow compared to other cryptos.  ETH faster and cheaper  XRP is already being used by banks.
D-Day is coming on Tuesday.  February 6th could potentially be a huge day for cryptocurrency.

1/ The crypto community generally prides itself on censorship resistance. It is the libertarian's ultimate paradise. Absent true extremes  say what you want  spend your money on what you want  and no one can take that privilege away from you
@CargoXio @INTCHAIN @genesis_vision @blockmasonio @blocktix @BittrexExchange @TheRightDefense @landon_wiggs I can only get burned if I lose money.

So @Chase is banning their customers from buying crypto currency via credit card "due to volatility and risk". Seems to me banks are getting worried of something they don't understand..   Decentralized currency will be the future and banks HATE that they will lose money.
@iamjosephyoung when can koreans get new money into crypto?
Crypto need a new leading coin with good tech that can take the market up  not down. Tired of BTC weakness
@CoinExchangeio Today Question is that how to we save this crypto world bloody scammer developer and exchange's need to think deeply at the end who loose money user's . Dev   exchange get money we loose money . exchange is also responsible for this scam.

And should there ever come a time I choose to make a cryptocurrency  it's going to be one that can be mined by anyone  bans the use of ASIC and isn't full of corrupt assholes and scammers.
@Sassman19 Let’s hope so! It’ll help the coins on Coinbase most of all  because they’re bridged with fiat. #Crypto may finally get some recognition!
@AltOne_Crypto That’s funny shit...
@BoredElonMusk Imagine a world where you get paid for your brainpower  like crypto currency is mined  it would be a horrible world  but it might be true  that is why we live & are trapped in a virtual simulation. Just thought of this  any thoughts?
@CryptoChoe Quick question. Let’s say you only had $500 total invested into crypto. Would you put it into a single coin that you believe will bring profit? If it does then you sell back out to fiat? Or would you split the money amongst different coins?
but no this is unironically me tho half my savings are in crypto because fuck the petrodollar but it’s also v sad rn <Emoji: Chart with downwards trend>

Not only are banks scared shitless of crypto  governments are too. Especially those who seek to slow down the progressive rhetoric of the cannabis industry! You can’t stop us. We won’t be stopped. You either join the new world order or get left behind with last year’s crops ;)

@Shillman_Crypto @Kingkonnolly I still need to check on partners but I have no reason to think it is a scam. However  it is a total shame they dealt with their community and investors such amateurism and disrespect. Not sure the cryptoverse can give them a second chance disregard of fundamentals.
@La__Cuen @vinarmani @eumartinez20 Channel funding is the max amount you hope to spend and the max that can be used for a hop. It is built for the wealthy and not the poor so it misses one of the main benefits of crypto.

@Cryptonoobie @notsofast @crypto_monger Bleutrade was the first exchange to list #Decred. It’s unfortunate Bleutrade’s volume is so low; only reason I’ve moved away from them. So  what might make them interesting is being one of the first exchanges to allow you to buy up-and-coming projects’ coins.
@markessien Lol  seriously this crypto thing is over rated. Last Dec  I was gonna cash out. Went to sell bitcoins. I sent the trade   price was at 17k  in my face as I was waiting for conformation  price went down to 16k. Confirmation took hours. When trade finally went  price was at 15k.

@chetanagmba @BHirapurkar @ArcBlock_io Very Shocking that they are charging penalty to the people who shows real interest and confidence in Crypto.I nevr saw ICO like this pls rethink about such rules and make these more investor friendly. @DiaryofaMadeMan u should not give suggestion on this kind of icos
As long as there are massive mining farms in China  #bitcoin and #Bcash's price will be manipulated and controlled by Chinese holders. Only truly decentralized coins will be able to circumvent that.#monero#verge#ripple#stellar#neo#Digibyte#ethereum#crypto#trading
@Crypto_Bitlord Pretty much yeah.
The value of cryptogenic largely depends on the number of people who know about this currency and use it to make transactions. ICO is one of the ways to attract attention from the online communities.#PECUNIO #Crypto #ICO

It then was said crypto market only needs 2.1 % of the derivative market cap to have that 70% valuation of the stock market  that 2.1 doesn't even have to come from the stock market. I expounded with my %
@Cernovich @TheMadPigeon "E-mail will never work" or "the telephone is a ridiculous invention that nobody will ever use" or "bitcoin is just fake internet money" or "cryptocurrency is all hype" - what a foolish thing to say. I can tell you haven't done an OUNCE of research into blockchain tech.

@paulkrugman @CallMeGwei I still haven't heard a good use case for cryptocurrency that isn't profoundly ignorant of basic economics.
Some irony everyone complaining about rentiers in '11-15 complain about real capital formers like Musk  crypto  etc in 2018. But I think it's smart: first man through the door always gets bloodied  and long history of capital formers just paying for others' consumption & returns.

@PeterSchiff @Coindriller @sabotagebeats @Jackson_Strong_ + the transaction cost is high because the technology is young and the scalability is being worked on. If you want to send value for almost nothing you can use other crypto like Litecoin. Bitcoin is just the first crypto  the one viewed as a store of value like Gold

@RonnieMoas Agreed - I think Nvidia is a steal after the recent Dow Jones sell off. One of the only stocks I’d consider outside of crypto!

@SatoshiLite If everyone everywhere has to be aware of a scam in the crypto world  wouldnt crypto be a scam as well because of how easily people can fork a coin into a potential scam? The bubble has popped on top 4 crypto BTC BCC LTC ETH. Too bad TPTB are keeping it down & wont let it happen
@crypto_rand @kaka90pl @BIRDSIDEPENGUIN And I would definitely agree  but there is one very large difference in that pattern.  That being said I agree with the logic behind this  going against the majority tends to be a good move.

Since many brand new “investors” use Coinbase  I like to compare crypto prices on Coinbase with the overall market average. When Coinbase is significantly lower I take it as a sign that inexperienced investors are over selling. $BTC $LTC $ETH
@WhoIam_ It's a war for sure a lot of casualties are being created. Bitcoin is influencing the market. However if it can hold 8000 I am not concerned. Have no doubt this is the field of crypto  it's uncomfortable especially if you are new but its not going anywhere anytime soon.

@cibc Amazing how every banking advert has crypto geeks bashing them. Emotional crypto-egoism fails to grasp modern economic theory that real currencies correlate w/ other asset classes. Bitcoin is  forensically  moving by (whale) wash trades. Gold beats inflation  and it correlates.
@coinbase @Crypto__101 @BankofAmerica denied my ACH transfer and told me they no longer will deal with any company dealing crypto. I moved everything to a different bank.

It’s worth noting that millions of people are lining up to buy crypto but the overall market’s been going down since $BTC Futures started trading. The only thing that makes sense is Wall Street manipulation. All the bad news is FUD  people must be immune to the false bans by now.

@Crypto_Bitlord Yes definitely. If not higher.
@Nouriel @rod_valens We are at the beginning stages of seeing how #cryptocurrency will create value. That’s why the market is volatile. It’s also why the possibilities are endless. Naysayers sound like people on the late 1800s and early 1900s who thought stocks were a scam.
@crypto_rand @Blaze_Crypto These longs don't matter and can't be used as an indicator  simply because you don't know who holds the longs. It could easily be the smart money who scared out the other market participants. This could very well mean a fucking crazy pump is coming.
@Crypto_Bitlord More like 1k next week just wait for bloody monday
@crypto_rand @koning_marc You didn't ever retweet a bitmex or binance reference link did you? I instablock that kind of garbage with extreme prejudice

@crypto_rand Just like any major market. In FOREX the indicator is called SSI   in short  the sentiment index. When the sentiment of retail traders is overwhelmingly skewed to one direction  the market usually moves in the other direction 1/2
@Super_Crypto @marcmnich They don’t want to kill it  they want to steal it. The longs soon dropped after 20k  right?
@MontanaSkeptic1 Biggest surprise for me is that cryptocurrency crash has not been more Tesla negative  given what I thought might have been shareholder overlap. But I think the effect may come in if Bitcoin goes lower than 5000-7000 or so (breakout price).
@Crypto_Bitlord So true.  I usually end that entire thought process with  'Fuck it  I'll just hold for a few years."

@PeterSchiff @Coindriller It's simple.

@Cryptopathic @pierre_rochard ‘...only has value as a medium of exchange so long as people are willing to accept it.’so  the anti-crypto argument is to boldly describe bitcoin only having value based on the exact same principles of anything else. brilliant.
Get the fuck out of crypto @CryptoCoinsNews
@crypto_rand @mackcrypto @uhuinfinity So let me fix this for you. Correct question would be: "Why should a dump follow when we have a long high ? what does 'spoofed market' mean? does it make sense or bitfinexed is an idiot blocking everybody against him?"

holding a ton of bitcoin or ethereum is meaningless unless the tech gets adopted and is then used...use value matters...it's shocking how little this gets mentioned. making fiat off of trading is not what crypto is about.

@special_sits Yes  or other cryptocurrency. Many said it  and polls I and others have conducted confirm. Many secretly bought.
@ForeignShooter Hi  payment networks like Visa had listed cryptocurrency sellers in the wrong merchant category. Cryptocurrency purchases are quasi-cash transactions  meaning they're directly convertible to cash  and should've been subject to cash advance fees from the start. ^MD
@crypto_bobby Thanks for the video explaining in-flow and out-flow in regards to tether. It made me realize my rudimentary ballpark analysis was wrong. The only saving grace for the market is that we've had multiple corrections along the way.
Random thoughts on the crypto markets - 1) Everything is still tied to $BTC 2) Futures was a major catalyst behind this rise and fall 3) At some point alt will get delinked from BTC. Not there yet. $ETH obv most well positioned at this point.
@crypto_rand The only thing I would say is the previous 2 times longs hit highs btc was in an uptrend vs this time in a significant downtrend which might lead to a different reaction  thoughts?
@vinarmani What about the govt?  (not you or me the individual)  Same there?   Can they too stop the "violent" use of crypto-currency? (whatever that is.. I'm just running with the phrase to explore the position)
@Super_Crypto I agree with you. I typically see these as contra indicators though. Ie.... shorts high near bottoms and longs high near tops.

There is no "secret" to crypto investment. The #1 tool is critical thinking skills. Investigate thoroughly  and learn how the technology works. Research the project  is it PoW? PoS? Limited supply? Actively developed? Does it demonstrate measured advantages over others? #Crypto
@iamjosephyoung I like crypto because it’s trustless unlike fiat which is not controlled by the “people” but by world governments that are more and more inclined to manipulate and inflate the price to create “economic growth” and pay for endless war.
@theonevortex @fnietom The issue with your statement is that if a fraction  of the asset is trading such as BTC which easily manipulated this represents the value of the total asset.I am not sure you ever worked in the financial world to understand the implications of it.Are you a crypto kid?
@CNBCFastMoney @solitude_dude2 @RudyHavenstein I think it may be closer to the truth that for most toddlers of Millennials  someone's lucky crypto investment is their one (long) shot at any inheritance.

@SGBarbour I think a "robinhood+ square" model is more likely.  Centralize exchange between apple stock and crypto so a user can  spend whatever assets they desire to make purchases  retailer can accept transaction in dollars.
@themotleyfool @AnderskOlesen ^false. $Nvda has said that all crypto related sales account for only 4.5% of their top line growth
@Crypto_Bitlord Shit is about to hit the fan.
Looking for recommendation on a good crypto exchange where I can short $btc against my other altcoins such as $ltc $eth? Damn thing keeps pulling my alts down!
@CFCamerer Why do you think crypto negatively covaries w traditional market? My suspicion is that part of BTC boom is people pulling profits out of equities.
Another RED day! Getting into crypto wasn’t meant to be like this. It was meant to be fun and all GREEN everyday.  I was meant to feel superior to normal non crypto friends. Not them lording it over me. <Emoji: Loudly crying face>
That's what I'm hoping for ;)
@Super_Crypto Doesn’t there usually end up being more shorts at the bottom and more longs at the top cos most people are wrong  most of the time? pic.twitter.com/v3xpzknBIq
@crypto_rand When shorts suddenly increase - people scream on twitter that "smart money is gonna rek the shit out of btc". When longs suddenly increase - people scream that "smart money is gonna squeeze those longs very soon". Go figure.

@Nouriel @BitcoinEnquirer @CounterMarkets @bitcoincashuser @vinarmani In an ideal world. Real world  people have no time or expertise to do due diligence. They have jobs  take care of their families  put food on the table. They can easily be deceived like all current BTC holders.And it's these people we want to bring in if crypto is to succeed.
@Haejin_Crypto I'm glad that you made it clear that a lower low was your primary count. Just yesterday you said that you were NOT calling the bottom yet. My sense was that the bounce wasn't violent enough.
@officialmcafee i'm new at crypto  should i leave coinbase to go to eristica? you have no time for this
@FrankyBoi13 We'd hate to lose you as our valued customer. Please know that while we aren’t processing credit card purchases for cryptocurrency  you can still use your Chase debit card to make them. ^PE
The amount of scams/ponzi/hacks/phishing currently going on in the crypto market is insane. It's hurting the market and something needs to be done. It's like a 'cancer'  it needs to leave the body (market) before it can be healthy again.
@Crypto_Brahma Did you read their T&C? "The Total Token Supply will initially be fixed. However  the total supply may be increased at a later date. You will not necessarily be notified of any increases in the supply of Tokens."
@francispouliot_ Of course it is worthless. It has no future for sure. Moreover it has NO place whatsoever outside the FI system! None! However people being stupid in general saw a cheap "crypto" and fell in the trap of PR. Making quite good trades already shorting $XRP

@naval @ChrisBlec #Bitcoin as a currency is still a long ways at best. when decentralized exchanges capable of atomic swaps can instantly convert digitized “stable coin” fiat to any cryptocurrency then Bitcoin as a “store of value” use case might eventually fall apart.

@BrokerCrypto I would liker a consultation I am only looking at small size of about 20grand   do you have access where I do not . or a strong proven track record Ive put 3gs into crypto and looking for safety at this point im 35 so guessing fiat will be obdolete when i retirw
@Crypto_Bitlord I thought many were here to transition the world from fiat to decentralised monetary system. If cashing out was the only thing ppl look forward to- it's a bubble that has to burst either today or tomorrow. It rather burst today.

@DiaryofaMadeMan I totally agree with Ian’s statement  we have been given a great opportunity getting into crypto in it infancy but I have a feeling we will ruin it for ourselves and they will ONLY seek private investment and we will only have access once it hits the exchange! CHANGE REQUIRED!
@AltOne_Crypto So you think we still have a further drop to go?
@Ripple @ArminVanBitcoin @lyserg1c once people start to learn we are all 'in crypto' and are facing issues we have to address to gain mass adoption  these cute little wars are a waste of time. im far beyond that  supporting cryptos i own or not own  as we all benefit from any adoption.

@Jean_Stream You can literally get companies like Trinity Solar to pay all the costs up front  you get free electricity for the life of the solar and after 7 years get to sell off your SRECs  so you profit off crypto and SRECs at the same time without paying anything. God... I hate New Jersey

@Nouriel @crypto In scale  possibly: in % of a market  no way.  2007  every cab driver  barber/strip club doorman was in flipping houses. Now just doormen.Unless someone borrowed stupid money at the top to buy bitcoin  it's a notional value of zero beyond the wasted energy to generate them.
So you don't like crypto fine! it Cost  you nothing.Why are these banks  and certain investors going out of their way to  discourage people from #Bitcoin and other #cryptocurrency. Seems like we are doing a good job crypto is life. I'm sorry but this is the new wave #HODL.
@Super_Crypto Most of weak hands are out. One lower low in des days with depressive impression in thé market Will be a Perfect moment To produce the break.
I know these folks who sold their bitcoin before 2017 gotta be physically ill whenever they hear anything crypto related
@Cointelegraph They are scared. You know I paid off all of my debt last month w crypto. Only one more debt... my mortgage
That said  Crypto is no place for retirement $. It's for beer money and avocado sandwiches instead. If you're going to waste it anyways then I think it's better spent as a gamble with huge upside potential.
My  regulated  401k was destroyed in 07. W/age on my side I have recovered. Crypto gets a lot of heat cuz its volatile/ unregulated. I think corruption and manipulation are blind to all of that.
@Jean_Stream I imagine the ultimate scam is running a crypto mining operation for a year to spike your energy consumption and apply for SRECs the following year. Legally you can't install more than 110% of your power consumption and still have grid tied solar

@ImLisaO @JonathanS2111 I think everyone is underestimating the impact that true government regulations will have on crypto. It’s not only going to sting  it may be a crippling from which it never fully recovers. I dread the day.

@Crypto_Bitlord About a week ago i sold 60% of my $btcs. Pretty hard decision after 5yrs. That wasnt due to misbelief but they approached the magic number in a descending pattern. Unless living on daytrade every investor has to have objectives. Greed can kill.
one of the funniest things in crypto is seeing people get into technicals and like elliott waves and shit while angrily ignoring any info that would actually help them
@crypto_rand @TheDaveCarlson I'm still holding on XRP longer-term. Sold off both TRX and XVG during their massive pumps.
I only posted this to make fun of the article. It literally doesnt say anything about the future of crypto except for that iits "risky" and yet forbes still published this....
@steve_hanke This is censorship. Banks have no problem allowing customers to spend their money on guns  in a casino  to purchase alcohol  and other risky decisions. But  $crypto is too far? Really?! If anything  this move only reinforces the utility of #cryptocurrency.

@SwiftOnSecurity @trekologer You could put all your money into Bitcoin and discover down the road that you were right about cryptocurrency  but you invested in the equivalent of Betamax or Laserdisc. Nothing sound about that.
With that being said  If cashing out 20-30% of your holdings could change your life in a major  meaningful way  do it.Not doing so would be extremely irresponsible. Pay off loans  clear any debts  free yourself. $crypto

@officialmcafee John you're definitely right.  The growth of the leading cryptocurrency has been exponential in 2017  2018 may look similar. In fact there is no need being sceptic about the ongoing revolution as a normal technological evolution. The truth is there  the facts have prooven it.

$btc is a centralized point of attack to the entire crypto market. Crypto Assets need to be priced in a more stable currency to prevent this from being possible.
@coinexcom @Bitfinexed Actually this could be a good thing if they allow USDT/fiat. The one thing that is keeping the bubble inflated is that there are very limited ways in which you can exit a tether position (besides buying into other crypto). Kraken only allows USDT/USD pair.

@Nouriel The fiat that people pay taxes in “fiat currency” has always been a thin way to tie economic output with currency value. Crypto’s utility *could* easily surpass this.

@crazy_crypto I've got a spot on the chart at $4.9k I've been watching since October. I've got a strong case for a reason why it *could go there. In the meantime though... I think we likely spend a couple of months above $7.5. We're still above the 200MA atm...that line won't give easy.

@YahooFinance How much more hypocritical can these fat cats get? You're allowed to  use your credit card in brothels  clubs  bars  everywhere else that profits the bank to buy things you can't afford  but block cryptocurrency. Shame on them. The time for big banks is ending. Quick and painful.
wouldn't it have been more prudent for banks to set limits on crypto buying with credit cards? like actual exchanges do...seems denying it totally is outrageous behavior for supposedly free enterprise institutions.

@RogueRepub1981 @Bigg_Jus The people making the wire transfers right now do not have the ability to get crypto currency. Bit Coin won't be seen as legitimate under the table wages. Plus  it's a now issue not a down the road issue.

@naval @ChrisBlec @SasgoraBooks @paul_btc I think we’ll see answer to this over the next few years. My hunch is that most of ICOs executed over last year will tend to zero  and people will likely save their BTC/ETH.

@Nouriel @VolkanTopalli Mate  it is an asset while it has value. Crypto segment provide value in terms of speed and low cost of transactions however still a long way to go before it can take a predominant and relevant position as an alternative currency. BTC on the other hand is already obsolete.
@criptopaul Absolutely not. Tether is no more than a promissory note for an unverifiable mystery asset. It's got nothing to do with crypto and is effectively worthless. Authentic market backed  decentralised crypto such as BitUSD is what's bullet proof and should be used.

@TheEconomist @mjavi310 Looking at the increasing number of use cases for the various forms of cryptocurrencies however  it's looking like crypto is on the verge of crossing over into the mainstream. Personally  I'm gunning for crypto to win the ideological battle  but hey  who knows

@CoinMarketCap @End_Bilderberg @OLI2020F @bradmillscan @antimetica @notsofast ETN have been open about the fact it is a stimulation and not real mining. They stated that they want more people involved in crypto and this is an easy way for people to get and understand crypto using resources they already have etc. The 'mining' is just to draw new ppl in.
90% of #crypto community is retarded. When #Bitcoin price goes up or down they scream “Market manipulation!!” and “Goddamn #whales!” Because a lot of people buy or does something  altering the price  does not mean it’s manipulated  it’s how the market works. Go take a course on..

@jearle I suppose the vaguely serious point is that  that thread is very interesting because I am so ignorant of bitcoin/cryptocurrency topics I can't be entirely certain that it isn't a complete piss take.
@DougPolkPoker I would love to see the look on the nay sayers faces after Bitcoin & all the other crypto’s hit the bottom & then shoot up & beat their previous highs because it is coming. They obviously don’t know how this market works. This is a buying spree!

@TheEconomist @mjavi310 Gold wasn't always universally valued the way it is today. When people perceive something to be valuable  they confer value on it. Right now you see a crazy battle of ideologies between crypto critics and crypto enthusiasts. Nobody knows which side will win.
@BTCDJS @Crypto_Bitlord @CryptoHoyt On what? This tweet is meaningless.
Indian government very bad decision for crypto users arrested and 3 to 7 year punishment....very bad i hated this rule ..
@francispouliot_ @CryptoAka Crypto is a perceived asset which has the same value as the fiat it was swapped for however the value of fiat is purely speculative as it’s based on a paper ink and a promise hardly a tangible asset. Major difference with crypto is the accessibility for all people !
@tehMoonwalker How would have milton liked a capped crypto like Btc which cannot be manipulated? It totally destroys his theory of money equilibrium. Friedman the smart man he was is all for manipulating the money supply and going pure fiat.
@polemitis @piramida If you are wanting an opinion then its bearish. This is crypto  you have to view things ST only. Earlier today it looked bullish but my overall view is its heading south.
People still bearish could it be a bloody Monday tomora#litecoin #bitcoin #cryptocurrency  pic.twitter.com/lYIVPodFZZ
@veronicatorras @ZarkMuckerbarn @alexpfeiffer @CullensAnton @ZeSuperDupont My opinion is that speculation in crypto is suicide... sooner or later you fail badly. So I prefer selecting a good product that I believe in and I support it. It will take time  but if you chose wisely you will be happy at the end and maybe not have a heart attack at every dip.
@BTCDJS @Crypto_Bitlord Obviously when posting stupid stuff :(
@CRYPTO_E_WORLD No "bitcoin genius" needs ads to make themselves known to the world. They just write code  are active in the community  or trade quite well as btc traders  believers  and generally speaking... are active on crypto Twitter :)

@CryptoWNF @DigiByteCoin @CryptoHour When this coin gets a little more social media hype im sure people will see how serious this coin is.

@Crypto_Bitlord @CryptoLincoln I like the initial comment  particularly bc investment often leads to common good and it's good to share knowledge. But this reply is exactly the sort of shit why "OG's" in Wall St are so popular. What amazes me is why so many ppl on Twatter pretend Crypto St is different.
@WolfOfPoloniex yup  pretty sad we're only taught the 'white version' of history in western countries. So many different sides to history that aren't presented to us in school. It's almost like noobs reading crypto news. just fed bs

@amtvmedia That's why its so important to invest NOW into the right companies/crypto BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. 75% of the jobs out there will be GONE. I can see it as clear as day. I'm a software engineer and the first thought which crossed my mind was  OMG how are these ppl going to find jobs?
